About This Program

Hey!

This “Video Clipper Pro” app is a simple tool I made to split long videos into shorter clips.
It is NOT a virus or any kind of malware.
The source code is open and fully visible—feel free to check it yourself or on GitHub.

Because the app was built with PyInstaller (which packages Python scripts into a .exe), some antivirus programs like Windows Defender or Avira might give a false positive warning. This is a common problem for homemade programs and small tools that aren’t widely distributed or signed by a big company.

You can be sure:

The program does not download anything from the internet.

It does not collect or send any data.

It simply helps you cut videos, nothing more.

If you (or your IT) want to check:
The full source code is included and you can even run it directly with Python if you prefer.

If you have any questions, just ask!
